#Q-1 ) Diameter of a binary tree
#https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/
#(5 marks)
#(Easy)
#Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
#The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two
#nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
#The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
#between them.
#Example 1:
#ï¿¼
#Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
#Output: 3
#Explanation: 3is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root: return 0
        result = 0
        def maxPath(root):
            nonlocal result
            if not root: return -1
            left = maxPath(root.left)
            right = maxPath(root.right)
            result = max(result, 2 + left + right)
            return max(left, right) + 1

#Q-2) Find the Town Judge (5 marks)
#https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/
#(Easy)
#In a town, there are n people labelled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of
#these people is secretly the town judge.
#If the town judge exists, then:
#1. The town judge trusts nobody.
#2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
#3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
#You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person
#labelled a trusts the person labelled b.
#If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.
#Otherwise, return -1.
#Example 1:
#Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
#Output: 2
#Example 2:
#Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
#Output: 3
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        adj_list2 = defaultdict(int)
        
        for t in trust:
            adj_list[t[0]].append(t[1])
            adj_list2[t[1]] += 1
        
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if len(adj_list[i]) == 0 and adj_list2[i] == n-1:
                return i
        return -1





#Q-3) Find Center of Star Graph (5 marks)
#https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/
#(Easy)
#There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A
#star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that
#connect the center node with every other node.
#You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates
#that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given
#star graph.
#Example 1:
#Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
#Output: 2
#Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other
#node, so 2 is the center.
class Solution:
    def findCenter(self, edge: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if edge[0][0] in edge[1]:
            return edge[0][0]
        else:
            return edge[0][1]
