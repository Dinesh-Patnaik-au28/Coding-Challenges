                I served in World War ONE with the rank of Sergeant Major, 
                and was decorated for bravery (Though he dumped them in a canal, 
                after returning from the war).My experiences in World War ONE left him, 
                disillusioned and beset with ongoing nightmares, and I becomes determined, 
                to move to my family up in the world so that the powers who had always,
                mistreated them could no longer touch them.After the vendetta with the New York Mafia, 
                and during the year of the Wall Street Crash, 
                I am thomas Shelby became a Member of Parliament as a member of the Labour Party, 
                while lending the chair of the legal business to his older brother, Arthur Shelby.
